	// Pay careful attention to the use of trailing slashes in the routeâ€™s match prefix value. Stripping a prefix from a path requires multiple Routes to handle all cases. For example, rewriting /prefix to / and /prefix/etc to /etc cannot be done in a single Route, as shown by the below config entries:
	//   - match:
	//       prefix: "/prefix/"
	//     route:
	//       prefix_rewrite: "/"
	//   - match:
	//       prefix: "/prefix"
	//     route:
	//       prefix_rewrite: "/"
	// Having above entries in the config, requests to /prefix will be stripped to /, while requests to /prefix/etc will be stripped to /etc.
	//
	// Hence we need to declare two distinct RouteAction, one for paths ending with a final '/' and one for paths without
